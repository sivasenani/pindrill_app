# Mandarin Pronunciation Learning App (Pindrill)

## Objective
This project aims to help learners improve their Mandarin pronunciation using Pinyin. The app provides interactive tools to explore and practice Mandarin syllables and tones, supporting learners in building a strong foundation in spoken Chinese.

## Background
Pinyin is the official romanization system for Standard Mandarin in mainland China, using the Latin alphabet to represent Chinese sounds. It is an essential tool for beginners, as it allows learners to read and pronounce Mandarin words before mastering Chinese characters.

Mandarin Chinese presents two main challenges for learners:

1. **Tones:** Mandarin is a tonal language, meaning the pitch or intonation used when pronouncing a syllable can change its meaning. There are four main tones, plus a neutral tone, making accurate pronunciation crucial.
2. **Limited Sound Set with Subtle Differences:** Mandarin has a relatively small set of possible syllables, but many of these are very similar to each other. For example, the distinction between palatal sounds in English and the near-palatal and velar sounds in Mandarin can be subtle and difficult for learners. Careful listening and practice are required to master these differences.

> **Note:** While Pinyin is a valuable tool for beginners, learners will ultimately need to learn Chinese characters (either traditional or simplified) to achieve full literacy. However, Pinyin provides a practical starting point for developing listening and speaking skills.

## Current Features
- Explore 80 Mandarin syllables, each in four tones, spoken separately by six speakers (three male, three female).
- Listen to and compare pronunciations to develop an ear for tone and subtle sound differences.
- The dataset is sourced from [Tone-Perfect-Based-Voice-Changing-Dataset](https://github.com/Chuntung-Zhuang/Tone-Perfect-Based-Voice-Changing-Dataset/tree/main).

### Dataset Source
The original dataset was developed at Michigan State University: [https://tone.lib.msu.edu/cite](https://tone.lib.msu.edu/cite)

## Future Plans
- Expand the app by creating interactive tests and tracking learner progressâ€”an aspect missing in many existing apps.
- Add more syllables, tones, and speakers to increase coverage.
- Integrate character learning and recognition features.

Finally, please note that this is work-in-progress and is starting out as a toy app.
